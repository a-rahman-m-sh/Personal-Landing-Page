<h1>Landing Page Project</h1>
This Is my first project as a fron end devoloper .. 
Udacity gave me the starter code and I completed Java script code and added dynamicity to the code  and added responsive navigation bar 
I tried to make the site real project for a real reuseme of mine so I edited HTML and added  my own sections.
Basicly I Just added Few lines of code to CSS starter code.

Most of work was on java script.

finally I edited the nav bar to be humberger menu in phones and tablet .
